## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Data files not found:**
   - Ensure all CSV files are in the correct `data_acquisition/output/` directory
   - Check file paths in `app.py`

2. **Models not loading:**
   - Verify `week5_models` directory exists with all `.pkl` files
   - Check model file permissions

3. **Import errors:**
   - Ensure all required packages are installed
   - Check virtual environment activation

4. **Streamlit not starting:**
   - Verify port 8501 is available
   - Check firewall settings

### Getting Help

If you encounter issues:
1. Check the Streamlit logs in the terminal
2. Verify all data files are present and accessible
3. Ensure virtual environment is activated
4. Check Python version compatibility (3.13+ recommended)

## Development

### Adding New Pages
1. Create a new Python file in `pages/` directory
2. Implement the page function (e.g., `show_new_page()`)
3. Import and add to the navigation in `app.py`

### Customizing Visualizations
- Modify Plotly chart configurations in individual page files
- Update CSS styling in the main `app.py` file
- Add new metrics or calculations as needed

## Security Considerations

- **Data Privacy:** All data processing happens locally
- **Model Security:** Trained models are stored locally
- **Access Control:** Consider adding authentication for production deployment

## Production Deployment

For production deployment:
1. Configure secure hosting environment
2. Set up proper authentication and authorization
3. Implement data encryption and secure connections
4. Monitor application performance and usage
5. Regular model updates and retraining
